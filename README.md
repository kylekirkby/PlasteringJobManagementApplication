Plastering Job Management Application
=====================================

This is a PyQt4 and Python3 Application to help plasterers manage their jobs and clients.

#Prerequisites
1. PyQt4
2. Python 3

The above are required to run the source code of this application. However if you can compile it using cx_Freeze you can create a standalone executable of this python application. By now I may of added a folder of compiled versions of the program.
